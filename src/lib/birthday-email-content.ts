Today the timetable pauses — just for you.<br/>
Another year of dreams in MBA blue,<br/>
Marketing minds and hearts that stay true.<br/><br/>
May classes feel light, may deadlines be kind,<br/>
May joy find you quickly, may peace fill your mind.<br/>
The whole MSM family sings this refrain:<br/>
<strong>Happy Birthday, ${firstName} — shine on again!</strong>`,

    `${firstName}, on this morning so bright,<br/>
The cohort gathers to share the delight.<br/>
Your laughter in corridors, your spark in the room —<br/>
Today we declare you the star of the bloom.<br/><br/>
From Manipal skies to the dreams you pursue,<br/>
We’re lucky to study and grow beside you.<br/>
So blow out the candles, stand tall, take a bow —<br/>
<strong>Happy Birthday, dear friend — we celebrate you now.</strong>`,

    `A toast to ${firstName}, our MSM pride,<br/>
On this birthday ride, side by side.<br/>
You turn pages of life with courage and grace,<br/>
A warm, steady light in our fast-paced race.<br/><br/>
May fortune be gentle, may friendships stay near,<br/>
May every small wish become crystal clear.<br/>
Ram and the batch send this poem your way —<br/>
<strong>Have the happiest, brightest birthday today!</strong>`,

    `Happy birthday, ${firstName} — listen close:<br/>
You're the punchline we love and the friend we toast most.<br/>
Through presentations, pressure, and Term 5 rain,<br/>
Your spirit keeps lifting us again and again.<br/><br/>
So here’s a small verse from your cohort with care:<br/>
Walk into this year with confidence to spare.<br/>
Roll ${rollNumber}, today belongs to you —<br/>
<strong>MSM stands up and says — we’re proud of you too!</strong>`,

    `${firstName}, the calendar chose you today,<br/>
So MSM pauses its usual fray.<br/>
No case study stress can steal this sweet hour —<br/>
You bloom like a flower in cohort power.<br/><br/>
May kindness surround you, may laughter be loud,<br/>
May you feel every bit as special as proud.<br/>
From morning chai rituals to stars after dusk —<br/>
<strong>Happy Birthday — in you, we trust.</strong>`,

    `For ${firstName}, born to stand out in a crowd,<br/>
Today we say it clearly and proud:<br/>
Your heart is a compass, your smile is a song,<br/>
You’ve carried us gently when days felt too long.<br/><br/>
Another year dawns — fresh canvas, new art —<br/>
Keep painting your story with courage and heart.<br/>
The batch sends this poem on ribbons of light —<br/>
<strong>Happy Birthday, ${firstName} — shine fierce, shine bright.</strong>`,

    `Roll ${rollNumber}, today is your day,<br/>
And MSM has something poetic to say:<br/>
You’re chapters of kindness in our shared book,<br/>
The friend we all search for with just one look.<br/><br/>
May blessings pour softly, may goals feel near,<br/>
May this new age welcome you without fear.<br/>
So dance through the hours however you please —<br/>
<strong>Happy Birthday, ${firstName} — take all the ease.</strong>`,

    `${firstName}, like monsoon after heat,<br/>
Your birthday makes ordinary hours sweet.<br/>
You’ve shared notes, shared jokes, shared quiet support —<br/>
Today we return love of the wholehearted sort.<br/><br/>
Stand tall in the spotlight — you’ve earned every line<br/>
Of this little poem from your MSM tribe.<br/>
May joy wrap around you in gold and in blue —<br/>
<strong>The cohort shouts loudly: Happy Birthday to you!</strong>`,
